# My Personal Website

## Description

This is my personal website submission for the Power Code Academy Prework Project: "Build a Personal Website." The goal of the project was to incorporate aspects of what I learned during the prework phase of my PCA candidacy, and to showcase what I learned on GitHub Pages. The webpage can be accessed [here](https://kyleghousel.github.io/my-personal-website/).

## What I Learned

In the construction of this humble personal webpage, I tried to incorporate as much as I could from the prework content, as well as ideas I've picked up from my own exploration or through the linked external resources from the coursework. I tried to approach the HTML structure of the website in a way which would allow me to apply Flexbox to the styling of the site. Shoutout to [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - a truly fun and effective way to learn a new concept. I have also included a few event listeners using Javascript. Namely, changing the main header on click, changing the mouse pointer when hovering over the main header, and enlarging the "Portfolio" list components I made when the mouse hovers over top of one. 

Regardless of the outcome, I've really enjoyed the time spent building these skills and knowledge the past few weeks. Thank you!
