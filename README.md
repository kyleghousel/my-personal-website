# My Personal Website

## Description

This is my personal website submission for the Power Code Academy Prework Project: "Build a Personal Website." The goal of the project was to incorporate aspects of what I learned during the prework phase of my PCA candidacy, and to showcase what I learned on GitHub Pages. The webpage can be accessed [here](https://kyleghousel.github.io/my-personal-website/).

## What I Learned

In the construction of this humble personal webpage, I tried to incorporate as much as I could from the prework content, as well as ideas I've picked up from my own exploration or through the linked external resources from the coursework. I tried to approach the HTML structure of the website in a way which would allow me to apply Flexbox to the styling of the site. Shoutout to [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - a truly fun and effective way to learn a new concept. I have also included a few event listeners using Javascript. Namely, changing the main header on click, changing the mouse pointer when hovering over the main header, and enlarging the "Portfolio" list components I made when the mouse hovers over top of one.

I learned about a new HTML element called iframe which was really cool. It was a moment of "It would be cool if I could just do a live preview of one of my projects. Oh...I can...NICE."

I started to get into media queries because I'm so used to responsive websites in my daily life that it bothered me that mine was not. It still isn't perfect, but it's mine and it's better than it was when I started.

Regardless of the outcome, I've really enjoyed the time spent building these skills and knowledge the past few weeks. Thank you!
