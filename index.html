        <p id="bio">
          <br>
          Two years ago, I was a teacher in North Philadelphia. While my love of teaching remained, it no longer filled my cup, and I began to contemplate what I wanted from my career. I wanted a career which allowed me to think creatively, engage in continuous learning and challenge myself daily. This led me to technology. Lacking any prior experience in this field, I decided to explore entry-level support opportunities and fortunately found myself at Power.
          <br><br>
          In his book “Outliers,” Malcolm Gladwell writes “The values of the world we inhabit and the people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we are.” Once at Power, I could envision multiple potential paths for my new career as I immediately found myself surrounded by intelligent, hard-working people I could draw inspiration from. Starting as a Support Ninja, I quickly discovered how much there was to learn, and was hooked. Beyond troubleshooting Nitro, I desired a deeper understanding of its construction and functionality. In my free time and after hours, I began my journey to learn programming. It was a conversation with Ben Klang that directed me to start with Python, given its beginner-friendly nature and similarities to Ruby. This would start me down my path. 
          <br><br>
          I delved into a online course named "Python for Everybody," absorbing the fundamentals of programming. Next, I found "The Odin Project,” which introduced me to Javascript and Ruby. This self-directed resource challenged me to navigate through concepts with minimal guidance, relying on the productive struggle inherent in building projects. Over several months, I built various projects from a basic Calculator with UI using Javascript to a game called “Mastermind” with Ruby. I began to apply my learning in my support role. I could now follow the breadcrumbs on Sentry errors, navigate my way around Splunk, and understand the browser console. Support provided me with amazing opportunities to learn and problem solve with each bug we encountered. I was fascinated in the instances in which I could pair with developers to step through issues we reported on, and I knew that being a developer was what I wanted to do. 
          <br>
          I craved a more active role in the Software Development Lifecycle, leading me to transition to Quality Assurance for the Connect teams. Here, I got to embrace the unique challenges of mobile development. I was delighted to be provided this opportunity to learn new processes and concepts. Pairing with developers during testing sessions broadened my understanding, and I utilized free time to work on SwiftUI projects, trying to learn as much as I could about the mobile world. Simultaneously, I began to pursue an ISTQB Foundational Level Testing Certification, driven by an unending desire to get better.
          <br><br>
          Being a Nitro Developer at Power presents a unique opportunity to join a like-minded group of individuals who demonstrate their creativity, resiliency, and growth-mindset each day. I’m excited to be a part of the Nitro Developer community, championing our “build it don’t buy it” mantra.
